Migration of the Time Entry Application\n\n- **Objective:** Migrate the interim workers' time entry system from Coldfusion to TypeScript using React.\n- **Achievements:** Complete redesign of the user interface for an enhanced user experience, integration of new features in TypeScript, improved performance, and maintainability of the code.\n\n### 2. Migration of the Payroll Calculation Algorithm\n\n- **Objective:** Migrate the payroll calculation algorithm for interim workers from Coldfusion to TypeScript.\n- **Achievements:** Rewrote the algorithm in TypeScript for both front-end and back-end use, optimized calculations for increased performance, and conducted thorough verification of result accuracy.\n\n### 3. Hourly Data Import from an External System\n\n- **Objective:** Enable the import of interim workers' hours from an external system into the Directskills application.\n- **Achievements:** Developed robust and secure import batches, automated the import process to reduce manual errors, and ensured data integrity through transactional insertion.\n\n### 4. Interim Workers' Billing System\n\n- **Objective:** Implement a billing system with grouping filters for hours worked (by analytical visibility, agency, period, etc.).\n- **Achievements:** Developed periodic or on-demand billing batches with various targeting criteria processing multiple SQL tables, optimized queries and processing, and utilized caching.\n\n### Training and Mentoring\n\n- **Continuous Team Training:**\n  - **Responsibilities:** Training new team members as they are recruited.\n  - **Achievements:** Initially worked alone on time entry and payroll calculation tasks, then trained and supported a new team member both technically and functionally. Subsequently, I also mentored two other new team members.\n  - **Leadership:** Conducted daily meetings, shared technical and functional knowledge, resolved blockers, and guided developers in task estimation.\n",
