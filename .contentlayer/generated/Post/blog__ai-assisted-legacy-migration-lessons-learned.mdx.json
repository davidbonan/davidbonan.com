    "raw": "\n\"This is going to be amazing,\" I thought, watching Claude Code analyze thousands of lines of legacy code. \"I'll just describe what I want, and AI will migrate everything. This migration that would take months? Done in weeks.\"\n\nFour hours later, I was staring at a screen full of hallucinated code that confidently referenced functions that didn't exist, implemented patterns we'd never used, and would have broken production spectacularly.\n\nThat was Day 1.\n\nWelcome to my two-month journey of discovering how to actually use AI for large-scale code migration—not the glossy tutorial version, but the messy, frustrating, eventually-productive reality.\n\n## The Challenge: Welcome to the Real World\n\nForget the blog posts about using ChatGPT to build a todo app. This was production code migration: extracting features from a legacy monolith and rebuilding them in a modern TypeScript monorepo. Not a greenfield project where mistakes are cheap. Not a prototype where \"good enough\" flies.\n\nReal migration. Real stakes. Real complexity:\n\n- **Interconnected systems** where changing one thing breaks three others you didn't know existed\n- **Domain knowledge** buried in comments from 2011, scattered across repositories, living only in senior developers' heads\n- **Architectural decisions** that require understanding why something was built a certain way before you can rebuild it differently\n- **Quality standards** where \"it works on my machine\" isn't acceptable\n\nThis is where AI tools promise the most value—and where most of them spectacularly fail.\n\n## Week 1: When Hope Meets Reality\n\n### September 18: The God Prompt That Wasn't\n\nMy strategy was simple: craft one perfect prompt containing everything. The complete feature specification. The legacy code context. The new architecture patterns. The migration requirements. Everything.\n\nI hit enter and watched Claude Code think. And think. And think some more.\n\nThirty minutes later, it delivered a comprehensive migration plan with detailed implementation steps. Beautiful formatting. Confident explanations. Complete hallucinations.\n\nThe AI had invented a caching layer we didn't have. Referenced a state management pattern we'd never used. Proposed migrating database calls to an ORM we weren't using. It was impressively wrong.\n\n**Hours wasted**: Too many to admit.\n\n**Production readiness**: Negative. We'd have been debugging for weeks.\n\nThe AI wasn't analyzing our code—it was pattern-matching against its training data and hoping for the best.\n\n### September 19: Breaking Down the Fantasy\n\nFine. Plan B: instead of one mega-prompt, break it down. Analysis prompt. Planning prompt. Review prompt. Test specification prompt.\n\nThe results improved immediately. The hallucinations dropped from \"complete fiction\" to \"mostly accurate with creative interpretation.\" Progress!\n\nBut here's the problem: \"mostly accurate\" isn't a thing in production code. You can't deploy a feature that's 85% correct. That remaining 15%? That's where the bugs live.\n\nI was spending more time fact-checking AI output than I would have spent just reading the code myself.\n\n## Week 2: The Uncomfortable Truth\n\n### September 22: When I Became the Bottleneck\n\nAfter three days of fighting hallucinations, the pattern became clear: **every time I actually understood the legacy code before prompting the AI, the output was dramatically better**.\n\nIt was almost embarrassing how obvious this should have been.\n\nWhen I blindly asked AI to analyze code:\n\n```\n\"Analyze this authentication module and create a migration plan\"\n→ AI invents patterns, makes assumptions, confidently wrong\n```\n\nWhen I analyzed it first, then asked AI:\n\n```\n\"This auth module uses JWT tokens with a custom refresh strategy stored in Redis.\nThe legacy implementation has three edge cases: [specific cases].\nCreate a migration plan that handles these cases using our new auth service.\"\n→ AI generates accurate, usable plan\n```\n\nThe difference wasn't the AI. The difference was me doing my job first.\n\n**Four hard-earned rules emerged:**\n\n1. **Ambiguity kills** - Every vague prompt produced hallucinations. Every specific prompt produced usable code.\n2. **You can't skip understanding** - AI amplifies your understanding; it doesn't replace it.\n3. **AI generates noise** - Specs needed manual filtering. The AI would include every tangentially related detail.\n4. **Validation is non-negotiable** - Human review of every spec, every plan, every assumption.\n\nThe new workflow: **Human analysis → Detailed prompt → AI generation → Human validation**\n\nThink pair programming, where you're the senior dev and AI is the talented junior who needs clear direction.\n\n### The Auto-Accept Mistake\n\nOh, and I turned off auto-accept for AI edits.\n\nWatching AI automatically commit changes to six files while I grabbed coffee? That's not productivity. That's gambling with production code.\n\n## Week 3: The Invoice Arrives\n\n### September 29: Let's Talk About Time\n\nTime to face the music. I started tracking actual hours:\n\n**Per feature migration:**\n\n- 25 minutes: Planning (reading legacy, writing specs)\n- 2.5 hours: Implementation with AI (review every change)\n- Unknown: Debugging architectural drift\n\nThat 2.5 hours of \"pair programming\" with AI? Half of it was:\n\n- Correcting course when AI went rogue\n- Explaining why we can't just \"refactor everything to use the latest patterns\"\n- Reverting changes because the AI's context window filled up and it forgot what we were doing\n\nThe brutal truth: **AI was making architectural decisions it had no business making.**\n\n**Over-engineering is the enemy of productivity**\n\n## October: The Month Everything Broke (Then Got Better)\n\n### October 3: The Multi-Model Epiphany\n\nThe upfront specifications I'd been creating? Useful for framing, but too shallow. The AI kept making wrong assumptions because my specs were approximations.\n\nThen I had an idea: what if I got multiple AI models to analyze the legacy code independently, then merged their insights?\n\n**The experiment:**\n\n- Claude analyzes the authentication flow\n- Codex analyzes the authentication flow\n- Cursor analyzes the authentication flow\n- Claude merge all three perspectives\n\nClaude noticed the error handling patterns. Codex caught the edge cases. Cursor identified the performance considerations. None of them got everything, but together? Comprehensive coverage.\n\nIt was like having three junior devs do code review—each catches different issues.\n\n**Time cost**: Higher upfront.\n\n**Quality improvement**: Dramatic.\n\n**Hallucinations**: Each model's mistakes were caught by the others.\n\n### October 13: Rock Bottom\n\nI decided to test \"autonomous AI development.\" Give it a clear spec, let it run, see what happens.\n\nThe results were... educational.\n\n**What the AI delivered:**\n\n- Branded types that looked correct but had the wrong phantom types\n- Variables with names that suggested one purpose but types that implied another\n- An abstraction layer so over-engineered it needed abstractions for the abstractions\n\n**The worst part?** The code compiled. The tests passed. It looked professional.\n\nBut it was wrong in subtle, insidious ways. The kind of wrong that slips into production and causes bugs three months later when someone tries to extend it.\n\nI spent more time fixing \"working\" AI code than I would have spent writing it correctly from scratch.\n\nThat was my lowest moment. \"Is this actually saving time? Or am I just creating technical debt at AI speed?\"\n\n### October 17: The Code Review Apocalypse\n\n**I was generating code faster than the team could review it.**\n\nMonday morning standup:\n\n- \"I have 3 PRs ready for review\"\n- \"Each PR changes 50-70 files\"\n- \"They're all blocked waiting for review\"\n\nThe team couldn't keep up. PRs piled up like snow in a blizzard.\n\n**Frequent small PRs?** Became blocking. Everyone spent all day doing code reviews instead of writing code.\n\n**Less frequent large PRs?** Unreadable. \"Can you review these 80 file changes?\" Nobody has that kind of attention span.\n\nThe irony: AI made me so fast that I became the team's bottleneck.\n\nWe needed a new strategy. Nested feature branches? Parallel development streams? Better separation of concerns so PRs could be independently reviewed?\n\nAll of the above, probably.\n\n## Late October: The Orchestration Revelation\n\n### October 22: The Five-Step Salvation\n\nAfter a month of chaos, the pattern finally crystallized. Every successful migration followed the same five steps:\n\n1. **Define precise scope** (not \"migrate auth\" but \"migrate JWT refresh token handling with Redis fallback\")\n2. **Understand it completely** (actually read the legacy code, not just skim it)\n3. **AI plans in PLAN mode** (get the strategy before any code)\n4. **Validate everything** (AI makes great suggestions and terrible assumptions)\n5. **Generate with oversight** (auto-accept still disabled, reviewing every change)\n\nSimple. Obvious in hindsight. But it took a month of mistakes to learn.\n\n### October 23: The Slash Command Breakthrough\n\nLate night coding session. Wait, what's this?\n\n**Claude Code can trigger custom slash commands.**\n\nMy brain immediately went to: \"What if I orchestrate multiple AI agents?\"\n\nBy 2 AM, I had a working prototype:\n\n- `/scout-explorer` → multiple agents analyze the codebase in parallel via Claude, Codex and Cursor\n- `/specification-plan` → synthesize findings into a coherent spec\n- `/build-prd` → generate detailed implementation plan\n\n**First test run:**\n\n- Analysis time: 3x longer than manual prompting\n- Quality: Noticeably better\n- PRD completeness: Actually comprehensive\n\nI was onto something.\n\n### October 24: When the Magic Stops Working\n\n**The problem:** The orchestrator was brittle. It worked when everything went right. When anything went wrong—API timeout, token limit, ambiguous prompt—it fell apart.\n\nComplex prompts to Codex via terminal tools? Unreliable.\nMulti-step agent coordination? Inconsistent.\nDepending on Claude Code to manage orchestration? Not happening.\n\nThe dream of \"set it and forget it\" automation died that day.\n\nI needed something more stable. Something I controlled. Something that wouldn't randomly decide to interpret my instructions creatively.\n\n## November: When It Finally Clicks\n\n### October 30: Building My Own Damn Tool\n\nEnough. No more depending on AI whims for orchestration. Time to build something reliable.\n\nOver a weekend, I built a CLI that orchestrates the entire analysis workflow. Not clever. Not fancy. Just reliable.\n\n**The flow:**\n\n```\n$ migration-cli analyze\n\n→ \"Which repositories?\"  [interactive prompt]\n→ \"Which AI models?\"     [Claude, Codex, Cursor - pick multiple]\n→ \"Task description?\"    [specific, not vague]\n→ \"Entry points?\"        [where to start analysis]\n→ \"Scope?\"              [what's included, what's not]\n\n[CLI runs in background]\n→ Clones repos\n→ Fires up chosen models in parallel\n→ Each analyzes independently\n→ Merges results into coherent analysis\n→ Generates PRD\n→ Breaks down into atomic tasks\n→ Parallel review of each task\n→ Generates test specification\n\nDone.\n```\n\n**First run**: 15 minutes of analysis, comprehensive PRD, zero hallucinations that slipped through.\n\n**Second run**: Same quality.\n\n**Tenth run**: Still consistent.\n\nFinally. Repeatability.\n\n### November 3: The Context Window Revelation\n\n**AI quality collapses after ~60% context window usage.**\n\nIt's not gradual. It's a cliff. At 59%? Fine. At 65%? Hallucination city.\n\n**The solution:**\n\n- Added `status.json` to track where we are in the process\n- Enable resuming from any phase (hit context limit? Resume fresh)\n- Removed bloated MCP servers (looking at you, Atlassian eating 18% context just by existing)\n\n**The result:** Migrations could run as long as needed without quality degradation.\n\n### November 4: The Template System\n\nThe missing piece: standardized prompts.\n\nI created three instruction files:\n\n- `01_plan.md` - How to analyze and plan\n- `02_code.md` - How to implement (with specific code style rules)\n- `03_review.md` - How to review for common mistakes\n\nEvery task now starts the same way:\n\n1. Read `01_plan.md`\n2. Reference the PRD and task\n3. Generate plan\n4. Human review\n5. Proceed to implementation\n\nAdded `.work-in-progress.md` to track current task state. When context gets heavy? Clear everything except the WIP file. Fresh context, no lost progress.\n\n**The rule that changed everything:** Clear AI context religiously.\n\nDon't let conversations grow. Don't let context windows fill up. Start fresh frequently with only the essential information.\n\nIt felt wasteful at first. \"But I just explained the architecture!\"\n\nThen I realized: explaining architecture to a fresh context takes 2 minutes. Debugging hallucinations from a bloated context takes 2 hours.\n\nEasy choice.\n\n## The Final Workflow: What Actually Works\n\nNovember 6th. Two months in. The workflow finally crystallized into something repeatable and reliable.\n\n### Phase 1: Analysis & PRD (The Foundation)\n\n**Run the CLI** for comprehensive analysis:\n\n- Multiple AI models work in parallel\n- Cross-validate findings\n- Generate detailed PRD\n- Break down into atomic tasks\n\n**Then stop and validate.**\n\nDon't trust it blindly. Spend time reviewing:\n\n- Does this PRD match reality?\n- Are these tasks truly atomic?\n- What edge cases did AI miss?\n- Where are the hidden dependencies?\n\nFix what's wrong. Approve what's right. Copy to the new codebase.\n\n**Time cost**: 45 minutes.\n\n**Value**: Avoids weeks of wrong assumptions.\n\n### Phase 2: Implementation (The Part You Can't Rush)\n\n**For each task, follow these steps religiously:**\n\n**1. Read the legacy code yourself**\n\nNot optional. Not \"AI will handle it.\" You read it. You understand it. Then you guide AI.\n\nAI without your understanding = hallucinations.\nAI with your understanding = productivity.\n\n**2. Generate the plan** with `01_plan.md`\n\nLet AI propose the approach. Reference the PRD. Reference the task. Let it think through the implementation.\n\nThen review every assumption.\n\n**3. If starting a new feature: Code the architecture yourself**\n\nThis is critical. Don't let AI design your architecture.\n\nAI will create something that works in isolation but doesn't fit your system. It'll add abstractions you don't need. It'll make choices that seem fine now but hurt later.\n\n**30 minutes of manual architecture saves 3 hours of refactoring.**\n\n**4. Let AI implement the details** with `02_code.md`\n\nNow AI shines. The architecture exists. The patterns are clear. Let it generate the implementation.\n\nBut keep auto-accept OFF.\n\nReview every file. Question everything that looks \"clever.\" AI loves being clever. You need code that's boring and maintainable.\n\nThis part is tedious. You'll review dozens of files. You'll reject changes that work but don't fit.\n\nDo it anyway. This is where architecture deviation gets caught.\n\n**5. AI reviews its own work** with `03_review.md`\n\nAI catches different mistakes than humans. Use it.\n\n**6. Retrospective**\n\nAI made the same mistake three times? Update your prompts. Teach it about your ORM patterns. Document your team's conventions. Make the prompts smarter.\n\n**The workflow isn't fast. But it's consistent.**\n\nEvery feature follows the same process. Every task gets the same scrutiny. Quality stays high even as velocity increases.\n\n## The Hard-Won Lessons\n\nAfter two months, dozens of features, and countless mistakes, here's what I learned about AI-assisted development at scale.\n\n### What AI Actually Excels At\n\n**Exploring large codebases** - AI can read thousands of lines faster than any human. Point it at a complex module and ask \"what does this do?\" Genuinely useful.\n\n**Pattern recognition** - When properly guided, AI spots patterns you'd miss. It sees the same error handling approach repeated across 20 files while you're still on file 3.\n\n**Boring implementation work** - Give it clear architecture and atomic tasks. Watch it generate boilerplate, implement CRUD operations, write repetitive tests. This is where AI pays for itself.\n\n**Multi-model analysis** - Different models catch different issues. Like code review with multiple devs, each brings a different perspective.\n\n### What AI Consistently Fails At\n\n**Making architectural decisions** - AI will confidently design elaborate systems that work in isolation but don't fit your codebase. Every time you let AI decide architecture, you create refactoring work for later.\n\n**Maintaining consistency** - Over multiple files, AI drifts. File 1 uses one pattern. File 5 uses a different pattern. File 10 invents a third pattern. You have to catch this.\n\n**Managing its own context** - Past 60% context usage, quality collapses. AI doesn't know this. It'll keep confidently generating garbage.\n\n**Refactoring without breaking things** - Ask AI to \"improve\" code and watch it create technical debt at impressive speed. It'll add abstractions you don't need and remove patterns you rely on.\n\n### The Four Rules That Actually Matter\n\n**1. Context Management is Everything**\n\nAI quality has a hard limit at ~60% context usage. Respect this limit or pay the price in hallucinations.\n\nSolutions:\n\n- Clear context frequently\n- Start fresh conversations often\n- Remove bloated MCP servers\n- Use work-in-progress files to track state between sessions\n\n**2. Human Understanding is Non-Negotiable**\n\nYou cannot outsource understanding to AI. Period.\n\nAI amplifies what you know. It doesn't replace knowing things. Every time I tried to skip understanding the legacy code, I paid for it later in debugging time.\n\n**3. Structure Beats Cleverness**\n\nAd-hoc prompting produces inconsistent results. Standardized workflows produce reliable results.\n\nBuild templates. Create checklists. Document your process. Make it boring and repeatable.\n\n**4. You Are the Architect**\n\nAI is a talented junior dev who writes clean code but makes questionable design decisions.\n\nYou design the architecture. AI implements the details. Reverse this and you'll hate your codebase in three months.\n\n## Let's Talk About Time (The Honest Version)\n\nEveryone wants to know: \"Does AI actually save time?\"\n\nThe answer isn't simple. Here's the real breakdown:\n\n| Phase                            | Time Investment                            |\n| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| **Initial \"Full AI\" attempts**   | Days of wasted effort                      |\n| **Workflow refinement**          | ~2 months of experimentation               |\n| **Current workflow per feature** | 25 min planning + 2-3 hours implementation |\n| **Manual corrections**           | Significantly reduced but still necessary  |\n| **Tool development (CLI)**       | Upfront cost, ongoing productivity gains   |\n\n**The brutal truth?**\n\nWeek 1: AI was slower than doing it manually.\n\nWeek 4: AI broke even with manual work.\n\nWeek 8: AI started pulling ahead.\n\n**Is it worth it?**\n\nFor this kind of complex migration: **Yes, but not how you think.**\n\nThe productivity gains don't come from AI writing code autonomously. They come from:\n\n**Faster codebase exploration** - AI reads thousands of lines while I grab coffee. That's genuinely valuable.\n\n**Reduced boilerplate** - Writing the 15th CRUD endpoint myself would be soul-crushing. AI does it in seconds.\n\n**Multi-model analysis** - Three AI models analyzing in parallel would cost three junior devs. I'm running it on laptop.\n\n**Standardized breakdown** - AI churns out detailed task lists that would take me hours.\n\nBut here's what the \"AI will 10x your productivity\" crowd won't tell you:\n\n**You still review everything.** Every line. Every file. Every architectural decision.\n\n**You still write the architecture.** AI can't design your system. Only implement it.\n\n**You still debug the weird stuff.** AI-generated bugs are often more subtle than bugs you'd write yourself.\n\nThe productivity gain is real. But it's more like 2.5-4x for careful developers, not 10x.\n\n## If You're About to Do This: Read This First\n\nPlanning a similar migration? Learn from my mistakes.\n\n### The Seven Rules for AI-Assisted Migration\n\n**1. Don't start with autonomous AI**\n\nI know it's tempting. \"Just let AI handle it!\"\n\nDon't. You'll waste days fixing hallucinations that seemed correct at first glance.\n\nStart with tight oversight. Loosen it gradually as you learn what AI gets right and where it goes wrong.\n\n**2. Invest in tooling upfront**\n\nThe weekend I spent building the CLI paid for itself within a week.\n\nCustom tooling seems like overhead until you're running your tenth feature migration and everything just works.\n\n**3. Multiple models > Single model**\n\nDifferent AI models catch different mistakes. Run them in parallel. Cross-validate findings.\n\nYes, it costs more. It also catches the hallucinations before they reach production.\n\n**4. Auto-accept is a trap**\n\nWatching AI commit changes while you grab coffee feels productive.\n\nIt's not. It's gambling with your codebase.\n\nReview. Every. Change.\n\n**5. You design the architecture**\n\n30 minutes of manual architecture work saves 3 hours of refactoring AI-generated abstractions that don't fit your system.\n\n**6. Clear context like your code quality depends on it**\n\nBecause it does.\n\nPast 60% context usage, AI quality collapses. Start fresh frequently.\n\n**7. Standardize everything**\n\nCreate prompt templates. Build checklists. Document the workflow.\n\nConsistency beats cleverness when you're migrating dozens of features.\n\n### The Code Review Crisis\n\nFair warning: you'll generate code faster than your team can review it.\n\nThis creates a new bottleneck. Solutions that worked for us:\n\n**Nested branch strategies** - Don't wait for PR approval to start the next feature. Branch off your branch.\n\n**Smaller, atomic PRs** - 50 files is too many. 5-8 is manageable.\n\n**Heavy test coverage** - Automated tests reduce review burden. If tests pass, reviewer focuses on architecture.\n\n**Scheduled review sessions** - Block 2-hour windows for deep review work. 15-minute drive-by reviews miss subtle issues.\n\n### When to Skip This Entire Approach\n\nThis workflow makes sense for complex migrations. It's overkill for:\n\n**Small projects** - Just use Cursor and move fast.\n\n**Prototypes** - Who cares about architecture? Ship and iterate.\n\n**Learning new tech** - Figure it out yourself first. AI later.\n\n**Simple CRUD apps** - Standard patterns, no complexity, AI shines without all this structure.\n\nSave the structured workflow for problems that actually need it.\n\n## What's Next: The Evolving Landscape\n\nTwo months isn't long in technology years. The tools are already improving:\n\n**Cursor** gets meaningfully better with each release. What struggled in September works smoothly in November.\n\n**Claude Code** keeps expanding context windows and improving orchestration. The limitations I hit today might be gone next month.\n\n**Custom tooling** becomes more sophisticated. The CLI I built in a weekend now has features I didn't know I needed.\n\nHere's the thing: **the best approach isn't picking one tool.**\n\nIt's building a workflow that leverages each tool's strengths:\n\n- **Cursor** for rapid implementation when you know exactly what you want\n- **Claude** for analysis and planning when you need to understand something complex\n- **Codex** for pattern discovery when you're exploring unfamiliar code\n- **Custom CLI** for orchestration when you need reliability over flexibility\n\nThe tools will keep improving. The workflow principles won't change:\n\n- Understand before you generate\n- Review before you accept\n- Design before you implement\n- Structure beats ad-hoc prompting\n\n## The Real Conclusion (Not the Marketing Version)\n\nHere's what nobody selling AI tools wants to admit:\n\n**AI isn't replacing developers. It's changing what we spend our time on.**\n\nBefore AI: I spent 50% of my time reading legacy code, 30% thinking about architecture and 20% writing code.\n\nWith AI: I spend 20% writing code, 60% reviewing AI output and making architectural decisions and 20% reading legacy code.\n\nThe total hours? 2-4x faster than before.\n\nThe difference? I'm not writing boilerplate anymore. I'm not implementing the fifteenth CRUD endpoint by hand. I'm not typing out repetitive test cases.\n\nInstead, I'm:\n\n- Designing systems\n- Reviewing architecture\n- Catching subtle bugs\n- Making strategic decisions\n\n**That's actually... better?**\n\nWriting boilerplate was never the fun part. Designing elegant systems? That's why I got into this field.\n\nAI handles the boring parts. I handle the interesting parts.\n\nAfter two months and dozens of migrated tasks, that division of labor finally feels right.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**AI-assisted development at scale requires more structure, not less.**\n\nYou can't just point AI at a problem and hope for the best. You need:\n\n- Tight human oversight\n- Aggressive context management\n- Standardized workflows\n- Custom tooling for your specific use case\n\nBuild the structure. Learn the tools. Understand their limitations. Review everything.\n\nDo that, and you'll see genuine 2-4x productivity gains on complex work.\n\nSkip those steps, and you'll spend more time debugging hallucinations than you would have spent writing code manually.\n\n**The future of development isn't autonomous AI.**\n\nIt's developers who master the art of directing AI effectively within well-structured workflows. That's where the real productivity gains lie.\n\nAnd honestly? That future is already here. You just have to be willing to do the work to get there.\n\n---\n\n_Two months in, dozens of tasks migrated, and the workflow finally feels productive. Not magical. Not autonomous. Just... productive. Sometimes that's enough._\n",
