As web applications become more complex, running heavy computations on the main thread can lead to unresponsive user interfaces and poor user experience. Web Workers provide a powerful solution by allowing us to run JavaScript in background threads. Let's explore how to implement them effectively.

## The Single-Thread Problem

JavaScript is single-threaded by nature. Consider this CPU-intensive task:

```javascript
function calculatePrimes(max) {
  const primes = []
  for (let i = 2; i <= max; i++) {
    let isPrime = true
    for (let j = 2; j <= Math.sqrt(i); j++) {
      if (i % j === 0) {
        isPrime = false
        break
      }
    }
    if (isPrime) primes.push(i)
  }
  return primes
}

// This will freeze the UI
const result = calculatePrimes(1000000)
```

Running this directly in your application would block the main thread, freezing the UI until completion.

## Enter Web Workers

Here's how to move this computation to a Web Worker:

```javascript
// worker.js
self.onmessage = function (e) {
  const max = e.data
  const primes = calculatePrimes(max)
  self.postMessage(primes)
}

function calculatePrimes(max) {
  // Same implementation as above
}
```

```javascript
// main.js
const worker = new Worker('worker.js')

worker.onmessage = function (e) {
  console.log('Calculated primes:', e.data)
}

// This won't block the UI
worker.postMessage(1000000)
```

## Advanced Worker Patterns

### 1. Worker Pools

For multiple parallel tasks:

```typescript
class WorkerPool {
  private workers: Worker[] = []
  private queue: Function[] = []
  private activeWorkers = 0

  constructor(private maxWorkers: number) {
    this.initialize()
  }

  private initialize() {
    for (let i = 0; i < this.maxWorkers; i++) {
      this.workers.push(new Worker('worker.js'))
    }
  }

  async execute(data: any): Promise<any> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const worker = this.getAvailableWorker()
      if (worker) {
        this.runTask(worker, data, resolve)
      } else {
        this.queue.push(() => this.execute(data).then(resolve))
      }
    })
  }

  private getAvailableWorker() {
    return this.activeWorkers < this.maxWorkers
      ? this.workers[this.activeWorkers++]
      : null
  }

  private runTask(worker: Worker, data: any, resolve: Function) {
    worker.onmessage = (e) => {
      this.activeWorkers--
      resolve(e.data)
      if (this.queue.length > 0) {
        const nextTask = this.queue.shift()
        nextTask?.()
      }
    }
    worker.postMessage(data)
  }
}
```

### 2. Transferable Objects

For better performance with large data:

```javascript
// Create a large array buffer
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(100000000)

// Transfer ownership to worker (faster than copying)
worker.postMessage(buffer, [buffer])

// The buffer is no longer usable in the main thread
console.log(buffer.byteLength) // 0
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Tasks Wisely**

```javascript
// Good candidate for Web Worker
const heavyTask = {
  compute: () => {
    // CPU intensive calculations
    // No DOM manipulation
    // No shared state dependencies
  },
}

// Bad candidate for Web Worker
const lightTask = {
  compute: () => {
    document.querySelector('#result').innerHTML = 'Done'
    // DOM manipulation not allowed in workers
  },
}
```

2. **Error Handling**

```javascript
worker.onerror = function (error) {
  console.error('Worker error:', error)
  // Gracefully degrade or restart worker
}

worker.onmessageerror = function (error) {
  console.error('Message error:', error)
  // Handle message serialization errors
}
```

## Performance Gains

Let's measure the impact:

```javascript
// Without Worker
console.time('Main Thread')
const result = calculatePrimes(1000000)
console.timeEnd('Main Thread')
// Main Thread: 1200ms (UI blocked)

// With Worker
console.time('Worker')
const worker = new Worker('worker.js')
worker.onmessage = (e) => {
  console.timeEnd('Worker')
  // Worker: 1250ms (UI responsive)
}
worker.postMessage(1000000)
```

## Conclusion

Web Workers are a powerful tool for maintaining responsive applications while performing heavy computations. Key takeaways:

- Use Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement worker pools for parallel processing
- Use transferable objects for large data
- Handle errors gracefully
- Measure performance gains

Remember that Workers come with their own limitations and overhead. Choose them when the benefits of non-blocking execution outweigh the cost of message passing and thread management.
