## Mission Summary

### 1. Creation of a Ride Assignment Algorithm

- **Objective:** Solve the planning issues for pre-booked reservations for a fleet of medical taxis, considering round trips.
- **Achievements:** Designed an algorithm that accounts for real-time traffic, data cost optimization, relevance of distances (distance to the ride and the ride itself), and delay tolerances to manage return trip adjustments. The algorithm adapts to real-time changes to optimize route efficiency.
- **Challenges:**
  - Order of assignments to ensure optimal relevance
  - Costs of real-time traffic API
  - System robustness for large schedules

### 2. Implementation of Caching Systems for Traffic Management

- **Objective:** Optimize traffic data management to reduce response times and costs while maintaining accurate forecasts.
- **Achievements:** Created two levels of cache:
  - A long-term cache providing imprecise data for large-scale predictions.
  - A short-term cache with more precise data for real-time ride management.
- **Challenges:** Response times of caching systems

### 3. Creation of a CRM for Fleet Management

- **Objective:** Enable fleet managers to supervise taxis, make manual adjustments to ride assignments, and manage billing.
- **Achievements:** Developed a comprehensive CRM including a transport voucher management tool, an automated billing system, and manual correction tools to improve flexibility in route management.
- **Challenges:** Fine-tuned UX with client operators for better understanding of the application and its capabilities

### 4. Integration of an LLM Model for Data Entry Simplification

- **Objective:** Automate and simplify repetitive data entry for rides, patients/clients, and transport vouchers.
- **Achievements:** Implemented a language model (LLM) to provide automatic completions and reduce the time required for managing reservations and client records.
- **Challenges:** Prompt engineering

### 5. Cloud Infrastructure with AWS

- **Objective:** Design a scalable and high-performance infrastructure to host the application.
- **Achievements:** Deployed the infrastructure on AWS EC2 for hosting services, with MongoDB as the main database and DynamoDB for cache data management.
- **Challenges:** Need for robust infrastructure for a critical application

### 6. Automated Tests for the Assignment Algorithm

- **Objective:** Ensure the robustness and reliability of the algorithm in various scenarios.
- **Achievements:** Implemented automated tests to evaluate the algorithm's performance under different traffic and scheduling constraints and configurations.
- **Challenges:** Ensuring comprehensive test coverage and reliability
